The contents of `~/.config/nvim/`.

This is just a snapshot for sharing purposes. I won't be keeping it up to date.

A couple of TODOs:

* I should remove Ctrl-P as I don't use it anymore. I use fzf.vim instead.
* I should remove deoplete as it is superseded by coc.nvim and they fight with
  each other.
